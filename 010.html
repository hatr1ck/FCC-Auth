  	<!--
  	Welcome to the authentication project. After this course you will have a basic understanding of how user registration and login works in Node /Epxress Web API.

	  We start from adding a `form` tag that will have two attributes: `action` and `method`. `action` should be set to a link where we send our data to, so let's set it to "/register", and `method` defines the type of request that we making, in case of a post request it's "POST".

  	For example, here's a `form` element with `action` set to "/logout" and `method` set to "GET":
  	<form action="/logout" method="GET">
  	</form>
