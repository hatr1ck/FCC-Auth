<!--
Next in our form we create two inputs for password and for password confirmation. Those will follow similar logic as our username input. For both of those we will have a type attribute set up to "password", and for our names we will have a "password" for the first one, and "passwordRepeat" for the second one. For the placeholders we can say something like "Enter your password..." and "Re-enter your password...".
